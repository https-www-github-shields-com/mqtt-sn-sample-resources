## IBM MQTTS reference implementation

This code was written to go along with the original MQTT-S (as it was called then) specification. 
It is included here for historical interest as much as anything else.

The contents are:

- udp-client: an MQTT-SN UDP client library in Java
- C-client: an MQTT-SN client library and sample application in C. Needs environment specific additional code to run.
- gateway: an MQTT-SN to MQTT gateway in Java
- nqtt-s.pdf - an original paper describing MQTT-S
